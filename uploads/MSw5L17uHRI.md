# Strategy/How - Curiosity
That sounds exciting, big things to say. How are you going to tackle that problem. What's the strategy? How is this story going to play out?[3-4]

Focused on the near term, first mile of adoption. Don't sweat too much on how the future machine intelligence arc plays out. This should lead directly to what we've achieved in the product right now, and how this leads to early adoption.






Thereâ€™s a false dichotomy between applications for 

Muddy is predicated on moving users to working with software as quickly as possible. 



We encompass various interactions in which those resources are created and shared. In doing so, we create an end to end experience for users for work with their teammates and tools. 
























 


- In the file world, it either lived in a file storage system or inside of direct communication software.
- The closest thing to a nervous system of any organization today lives inside of its people to people communication. But even then it's "error handling"
- Kevin was right: Storage of a company's resources isn't enough. Encompassing team communication isn't enough.
- As tools moved to the internet, they developed their own file system and own communication workflows (comments and email notifications)
- So every tool anyone adopts, it becomes "yet another" place to look...
- The only solution to the "yet another" is to be a meta-layer. You have to contain the total activity of work being done with others. Most try to achieve this by pitching a mega application for work, we're doing to achieve this by containing all of the others. Comes at the consequence of the end user. 
- Any distance between resource activity (filing a PR, building an Airtable base) and the communication around it will find a way to be eventually disintermediated.


People put their software INSIDE of their communication
- They're doing it already! Look at the copious links, pins, mega link docs, etc being sent around
- What are people hacking today?
- messaging apps at work got adopted because it was fast and easy to get ahold of someone. It doesn't do the job, because it doesn't make it fast or easy to act on the request.
- There is nothing faster than putting the job to be done right in front of people's face.
- talk and use the context next to each other.



Create and use context right in the same place. By doing so we encompass a large majority, if not the entirety, of a teams' activity and resources.
- Use resources shared by others without ever having to open up a tab yourself, because they directly share as a tab.
- Open and create new documents from applications (Figma, Airtable, Sheets, Coda, etc), 
- Share through simple interactions, one button, zero button, drag, etc.
- Shared resources are automatically filed and sorted based on activity, brought into your screen by how relevant they are at any given time based on what others are doing.
- Every resource ever shared is indexed. Our search can work through all of the resources because they're rendered inside of Muddy.
- We can contain edges outside of internal communication and resources are easily contained inside of Muddy
	- Access email and calendar right inside of Muddy. Over time deliver on those competencies for free to enable tighter experiences for our users (Quickly create events, Multi-User Email Threads, etc)
- Muddy contains the entire lifecycle of a firm's resources, and the entire network of activity on those resources.





Users and softwares can leverage that network to make better decisions, get more done faster, and provide better services.






working with vast amounts of complexity satisfying
e believe that small groups of people can do insanely complex things!
